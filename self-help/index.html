      <div class="row"><p>Self Help Movement, Inc. was founded in 1967 by Dr. Joseph F. Ruggiero as an outpatient drug rehabilitation program for probationers/parolees. By the early 1970's the need for an inpatient program became apparent. A search led to a small building, at Byberry State Hospital called the "Farm house". Many hundred of hours of volunteer labor transformed the old, dilapidated building into "Self Help". The facility then housed 16 residents who received intense drug and alcohol counseling and rehabilitation. In 1975, the need for growth led Dr. Ruggiero, along with the Honorable James Cavanaugh, to petition the state to lease a small residential center for drug abusers on the grounds of the Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry. A larger, three-story building was secured on the Byberry grounds with a capacity for 40 residents. In addition to the residential treatment program, the new building housed a halfway program for graduates as well as administrative services for the newly incorporated Non-Profit. In 1982, negotiations were initiated with the State Hospital for a long-term lease in a newer and more efficient building on the hospital grounds. </p></div>
